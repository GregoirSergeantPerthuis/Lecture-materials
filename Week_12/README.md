# Intro to BioImage Analysis and Deep Learning Utilization

Introduction in the field of BioImage Analysis with a Deep Learning Utilization focus. We will discuss the challenges of BioImage Analysis, and you will learn about Community-Driven Resources not only for Accessible Deep Learning. The hands-on part will focus on knowledge and experience for the utilization of [Noise2Void](https://github.com/juglab/n2v) and [Stardist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist) deep learning models. But there is a lot more to explore.

The field of any image processing or analysis is very dependent on visualization. Since there is no straightforward way to interact with images in Google Colab, we will learn about how to use some of the tools in [ImageJ/FIJI](https://fiji.sc/) and [napari](https://napari.org/stable/). One lecture is not enough to introduce you to everything, but you will have here other resources to explore on your own.

If you want to learn more about me, check out my web pages [www.schaetz.cz/](https://www.schaetz.cz), I also have "starter guide" with sources I think are important for BioImage Analysis: [BiA Overview](https://www.schaetz.cz/bia-overview/intro.html). I am part of Czech BioImage Analysts’ Society ([CzechBIAS](https://czechbias.github.io/intro.html)) and Global BioImage Analysts' Society ([GloBIAS](https://www.globias.org/)).
