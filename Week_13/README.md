## Lecture material Week 13 - Deep Architectures for sampling molecules

### Gr√©goire Sergeant-Perthuis (Paris)

In this course will discuss how to compress times series of dynamics of one molecule using VAC, VAMP, VAMPNET. Does so allows in particular for clustering the conformations of the moleculebased on dynamical informations. Does so allows to learn a Markov Chain on these clusters called a Markov State Model. We will then see how to generate samples of the changes of conformation of the molecule leverage such compression. 

The exercice session introduces basic tools of Deeptime (https://deeptime-ml.github.io/latest/index.html) in which training of VAMPNETs and learning of MSM is made easier. The aim of the exercice is to generate changes of conformations of Alanine Dipeptide.
